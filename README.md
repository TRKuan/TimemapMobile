# TimemapMobile

The mobile version of [TimeMap](https://github.com/TRKuan/timemap-webapp).  
We use `react-native` and the same backend from [TimeMap](https://github.com/TRKuan/timemap-webapp) with additional auth server.

## Getting started

Set up the enviroment for [react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).  
Then enter the following comment at the root directory to run the app.  
```
react-native run-android
```

Note that for the app to function properly, you need to set up the server from [TimeMap](https://github.com/TRKuan/timemap-webapp).
